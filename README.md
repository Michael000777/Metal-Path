# Metal-Path
A project focused on assessing the impact of prenatal heavy metal exposure on childrenâ€™s health in a prospective cohort based in Mexico City. Evaluating transcriptomic and Epigenetic alternations assessed at adolescence.

**Project Plan**

This research project is my Master's thesis project here at the University of Michigan. 

**Aim 1**: Determine whether increased exposure to neurotoxic metals, during gestational and concurrent adolescent periods, alters the blood transcriptome of children assessed at adolescence. The working hypothesis is that differentially expressed genes will be enriched in neurodevelopmental disease gene pathways.

**Aim 2**: Determine whether alterations in the transcriptome at the identified genes pathways are as a result of differential epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation). The working hypothesis is that these identified genes will have differential levels of DNA methylation as a result of increased toxic metal exposure. 

This repo will include a snakemake workflow for processing bulk RNA-seq data sequenced, and other scripts including R scripts for various annotations and analyses made to reveal these differential expression of genes and impacted gene control mechanisms (DNA Methylation).
